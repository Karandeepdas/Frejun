This project is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** built with **React + Vite**.  
It displays a paginated, searchable table of comments fetched from [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).  
The project was built to complete an assignment, including bonus features for editing and persisting data.

## ðŸš€ **Features**
âœ… Paginated table of comments (10 items per page)  
âœ… Search bar in the navbar (filters by exact email match when the search button is clicked)  
âœ… Displays:
- Email
- Name
- Body
- Title of the post associated with the comment  
âœ… Clean, modern UI using **Bootstrap**  
âœ… Editable fields:
- `Name` and `Body` can be edited in-place  
- Each row has an `Edit` / `Save` button
âœ… **Edits persist after page refresh** using browser `localStorage`  
âœ… Responsive navbar with:
- Logo on the left
- About, Contact, Pricing menu items in white with spacing

### **Main Task (3 sub-tasks)**

#### **Sub-task 1:**
âœ” Built with React (Vite).  
âœ” Navbar created using Bootstrap, with search input on the right.  
âœ” Table shows comments, paginated with `react-paginate`.

---

#### **Sub-task 2:**
> Table must have the following columns:
> - Email
> - Name
> - Body
> - Post (the title of the post the comment is for)

âœ” Fetched comments data (`/comments` endpoint): includes Email, Name, Body.  
âœ” Fetched posts data (`/posts` endpoint): used `postId` to map to post title.  
âœ” Displayed all required columns.

---

#### **Sub-task 3:**

âœ” Search bar in the navbar.  
âœ” Filters comments by **exact email match** (case-insensitive).  
âœ” Triggered **only** when user clicks the search button (with a search icon).  
âœ” Does not search in name/body/post title (by design).

---

### ðŸŒŸ **Bonus tasks (2 sub-tasks)**

#### **Sub-task 4 (Bonus):**

âœ” Added an **Edit** button for each row.  
âœ” Clicking Edit:
- Turns Name and Body into editable input/textarea.
- Button label changes to **Save**.

---

#### **Sub-task 5 (Bonus):**

âœ” Used browser's **localStorage** to save edits.  
âœ” On page load, load edits from localStorage and merge over fetched data.  
âœ” Edits appear again after refresh; no backend needed.

---

## âœ¨ **Extra touches we added:**
- Navbar:
  - Logo on the far left (white).
  - About, Contact, Pricing links (pure white, spaced apart with `mx-2`).
  - Search bar on the right with white button containing a search icon.
- Edit button styled grey with white text (`background: grey; color: white`).
- Clean, responsive Bootstrap UI.
